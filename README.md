# Credit_Risk_Analysis

##  Overview

The goal of this project is to use the imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries in order to evaluate models using resampling for the credit industry. Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. As a result, we need to use different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. The output of the analysis is as follows in order to predict credit risk:

- [credit_risk_resampling](credit_risk_resampling.ipynb) 
  - Uses the SMOTEENN algorithm 
- [credit_risk_ensemble](credit_risk_ensemble.ipynb)
  - Uses Ensemble Classifiers
